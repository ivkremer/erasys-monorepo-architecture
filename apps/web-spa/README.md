# Vite App

This is a simple Vite (React + TypeScript) app with Tailwind CSS which uses the
[profile-images](../../packages/profile-images) package.

## Getting Started

```shell
npm i
npm run dev
open http://localhost:5173/ # see the link in the output
```

It’s possible to source the profile slug from your [`.env`](.env):

```shell
VITE_PROFILE_SLUG="profile-slug-value"
```

See [`.env.example`](.env.example).
